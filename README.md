# TicTacToe Server

In this repository, you will find the T3P Server. This was a project requested in the course Laboratorio de Redes de Computadoras, from FIUBA.

## How to compile and run

This server needs a linux kernel based OS in order to be compiled and executed. Before compiling, take a look at **config.h**, located in folder **headers**. Here you will find some
configurations to be made, such as the server IP and the TCP and UDP ports that runs on.

In the root folder, you will find a bash script: **make_server.sh**. This script will compile all the files and output an executable file called **server.out** in the same folder.

After running the script, type ./server.out to start the server.
